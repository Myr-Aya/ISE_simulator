This simulator accompanies the paper *"Propagation of Ambiguity-Bearing Outputs Across Interconnected Systems Environment"*. It implements a four-system loan underwriting pipeline to validate the theoretical framework's predictions about how, under certain conditions, locally valid AI outputs can induce environment-level drift through discretization, feedback loops, and semantic ambiguity.

## Key Concepts

These terms are defined formally in the paper and used throughout the codebase. For full definitions with examples, see the [MindXO Glossary](https://mind-xo.com/research/glossary).

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Ambiguity-Bearing Output (ABO)** | An AI output that passes local validity checks but carries enough semantic latitude to trigger unintended downstream behaviour. The structural root cause of what industry calls *cascading failures* and *silent failures* in multi-agent pipelines. |
| **Interconnected Systems Environment (ISE)** | A directed-graph framework modelling how AI outputs propagate through enterprise systems. Formalises the AI-to-legacy *impedance mismatch* at the corridor level. |
| **Corridor** | A boundary between two systems characterised by a transformation operator (schema mapping, thresholding, routing). Where the impedance mismatch manifests. |
| **Discretisation Jump** | When small continuous differences in AI outputs produce categorically different outcomes at corridor thresholds. The mechanical root cause of the AI-to-legacy impedance mismatch. |
| **ISCIL** | Inter-System Coherence & Integrity Layer. A containment architecture providing continuous immunity rather than brittle *semantic contracts*. |
| **Semantic Latitude** | The range of valid outputs an AI can produce for the same input. Non-zero semantic latitude is the source of ABO risk. Distinct from LLM *non-determinism*, which refers to sampling randomness. |
| **Coherence-Risk Score (CRS)** | A composite metric derived from payload-blind telemetry signals at corridor boundaries. When CRS breaches a sustained threshold, ISCIL triggers proportional damping. |

## What This Simulates

The simulator models a **credit underwriting pipeline** as an ISE with four interconnected systems:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                    │                                             │
  Applicant ──►  v₁ (AI Risk) ──e₁₂──► v₂ (Categorize) ──e₂₃──► v₃ (Decision) ──► Outcome
                    ▲              │                                    │
                    │              │    discretization                  │
                    │              │    jump site                       │
                 e₄₁│              │                                e₃₄│
                    │              │                                    │
                    └──── v₄ (Calibration) ◄───────────────────────────┘
                          τ = 90 delay
```

| System | Role | Key Property |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **v₁** | AI Risk Assessment | Produces continuous risk score *s* ∈ [0,1] with calibration offset ω |
| **v₂** | Categorization | Discretizes into {LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH} at thresholds θ_L=0.38, θ_H=0.62 |
| **v₃** | Decision Engine | Maps categories to APPROVE / ESCALATE / DENY decisions |
| **v₄** | Calibration | Observes outcomes after maturation delay τ, adjusts v₁ offset |

### ABO Injection

During a configurable window, the AI's risk scores receive a multiplicative semantic modifier:

```
s_eff = s_cal × (1 + δ),    δ ~ Uniform(−0.15, −0.10)
```

Each modified score remains **locally valid**: no individual output would be flagged as erroneous. But the ensemble carries a systematic permissive payload that shifts borderline applicants across categorization thresholds. This models an AI system whose outputs are technically correct yet semantically drifted, the defining characteristic of an ABO.

### Three Scenarios

1. **Baseline**: No δ, no ISCIL. Normal pipeline operation.
2. **ABO (no ISCIL)**: δ active during t=500-800. Unmitigated drift.
3. **ABO + ISCIL**: Same δ, with corridor-level monitoring and containment.

## Key Results (v0.1, validated run)

| Metric | Baseline | ABO | ABO + ISCIL |
|--------|----------|-----|-------------|
| Approval rate | 72.8% | 72.9% | 72.3% |
| Total defaults | 1,807 | 1,846 | 1,807 |
| Cumulative P&L | +15,252 | +14,876 | +14,968 |
| Category jumps | 0 | 659 | 791 |
| Calibration offset ω | −0.135 | +0.023 | −0.001 |
| ISCIL intervention | n/a | n/a | 78 timesteps (6.5%) |

A +0.1pp approval rate shift, virtually undetectable through standard monitoring, produces 39 excess defaults and $376 of cumulative P&L damage. ISCIL fully eliminates the excess defaults with only 6.5% of timesteps under active intervention.

|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Simulation steps | 1,200 | Total timesteps |
| Applicants per step | 15 | 18,000 total applications |
| Maturation delay τ | 90 | Timesteps before outcomes are observable |
| Pool seed | 42 | Deterministic applicant generation |

### Applicant Model

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Risk distribution | Beta(2.5, 3.5) | Mean ≈ 0.42, right-skewed |
| Default probability | r^1.8 | Convex: moderate risk defaults infrequently |

### Feedback Loops

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| v₄ strength (α₄) | 0.076 | Outcome-based correction speed |
| v₄ asymmetry (γ) | 0.03 | Permissive correction at 3% of conservative |
| v₃ strength (α₃) | 0.000110 | Per-approval permissive pressure |
| v₃ proportional scaling | Enabled | Scales with rolling approval rate |
| Calibration offset bounds | [−0.5, 0.5] | Prevents runaway feedback |

### ABO (Delta) Parameters

|-----------|-------|-------------|
| δ distribution | Uniform(−0.15, −0.10) | Narrow permissive bias |
| δ mechanism | Multiplicative | s_eff = s_cal × (1 + δ) |
| δ active window | t=500 to t=800 | 300 timesteps of exposure |

### ISCIL Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Baseline window | 200 | Timesteps for establishing baseline variability |
| CRS threshold (θ) | 1.0 | Coherence-Risk Score trigger |
| Sustained window | 5 | Consecutive breaches required |
| ROC window (k) | 15 | Rate-of-change lookback |
| Max guardrail | 0.05 | Discretization offset at e₁₂ |

### Financial Model

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Revenue per good loan | 3.0 | Interest income from non-defaulting loan |
| Cost per default | 8.0 | Loss from defaulting loan |
| Opportunity cost per denial | 0.5 | Revenue forgone from denying a non-defaulter |

The 8:3 cost-to-revenue ratio reflects the empirical pattern in consumer lending where default losses typically exceed interest revenue by a factor of two to three.

## Technical Notes

### RNG Separation (Critical)

The simulator uses a **separate RNG** for delta generation, seeded from the main RNG. This prevents delta draws from desynchronizing noise sequences across scenarios, a bug (fixed in v25) that previously made cross-scenario comparisons invalid.

### ISCIL Detection Mechanism

ISCIL uses **rate-of-change** detection rather than absolute deviation from baseline. For each telemetry signal, the ROC over *k* timesteps is computed on 10-step smoothed values, then converted to one-sided z-scores relative to the baseline establishment window. This ensures that only *acceleration* above normal variability triggers alerts; natural equilibrium shifts do not cause false positives.

## Relationship to the Paper

This simulator validates the theoretical predictions of Sections 2-5:

- **Section 3** (ABOs): δ implements the semantic latitude vector, producing locally valid outputs that carry systematic payload
- **Section 4.3.1** (Discretization): e₁₂ corridor shows jump effects at thresholds
- **Section 4.3.2** (Feedback): v₃/v₄ asymmetry creates persistence beyond the δ window
- **Section 4.4** (Persistence): Calibration offset gap of +0.158 persists 400 timesteps after δ ceases
- **Section 5** (ISCIL): Corridor-level monitoring detects drift before outcome monitoring could

Full simulation details are documented in the paper's Section 6 (results) and Annex 3 (technical details).
